Samantha ,"My name is Samantha and I chose to donate to people effected by natural disasters. This really resonated with me as I have been in their shoes and I know having small luxuries is a great confidence booster.  In 2014 I was effected by a fire that destroyed my house and all my belongings, including my makeup collection. I know they will really appreciate this gift just like I would have."
Jennifer,"My friend used to get sexual violence by her ex, and cause her mental health problems for a longtime, I really want to help these guys who face the same problem and make their life easier"
Amy,"I volunteered in a orphanage school, some of their children faced the violence from their family before and had a bad effect on their rest of life. Make them stress, depression, also cause a mental problem when they grow up. I would like to help these children and help them to get a brighter future."
Mark,"I’m a Africa American, because I looks smaller compare with the rest of mine friends, also the different skin color, I got a mental and also physical violence during my childhood. I was not confident at that time, maybe it’s also can increase the risk of perpetrating violence."
